# Programming Digital Twins - pdt-exercise-docs

## Overview

This repository contains lab module directory structures and sample markdown files for use with the [Programming Digital Twins Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/programming-digital-twins/projects/1) exercises.

It is intended for student use to track markdown documentation for each lab module and to store relevant lab module configuration files (i.e., for the Edge Device App, or EDA).

### Project Objectives

The [LabBenchStudios-PDT-Unity](https://github.com/programming-digital-twins/LabBenchStudios-PDT-Unity) research project is intended to be used with this [pdt-exercise-docs](https://github.com/programming-digital-twins/pdt-exercise-docs) repository and has three primary objectives:

(1) Build a largely F/OSS Digital Twin framework that can work with other [Programming Digital Twins projects](https://github.com/programming-digital-twins) and their repositories to sync live data, DTDL models, and a JSON-based constraint mapping layer, and render within a COTS physics sim engine (e.g., Unity 6).

(2) Use a digital twin asset's configuration data to auto-generate a GPT AI prompt to query one or more locally running LLM's to retrieve predictive maintenance recommendations for the specific system within the Digital Twin environment.

(3) Provide a baseline technology platform for my Northeastern University College of Engineering graduate students (and me) to learn and experiment with various Digital Twin use cases.

## Organization

- README.md: For each lab module, the student is expected to complete the README.md template with specific details pertaining to the given lab module.
- eda{number}.props: For each lab module, there will be one or more eda{number}.props configuration file(s). These will need to be edited by the student to reflect the requirements for the given lab module. For those lab modules that do not require updated EDA configurations, simply copy the previous lab mdoule config file(s) to the new lab module directory. This will ensure each lab module has the appropriate configuration for any running EDA needed for that lab module.
